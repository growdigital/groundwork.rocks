# Simple static site blog template

Create your own static site blog based on [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), writing [modular CSS](/principles/). Make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:growdigital/groundwork.git
$ cd groundwork
$ npm run dev
```

Groundwork is for web designers and frontend developers who are comfortable with the terminal and who want a modular CSS and JavaScript workflow.
