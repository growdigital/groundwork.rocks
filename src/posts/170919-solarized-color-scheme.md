The colours[sic] for Groundwork have been updated to use the magnificent [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color palette. I’ve always wanted to use it for a website (indeed, I’m rebuilding [growdigital.org](https://www.growdigital.org/) using the same palette).

The colours live in [`variables.css`](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork/blob/master/src/assets/css/settings/variables.css). I’ve actually renamed the base colours to something memorable, rather than scattering `base01` etc throughout the code. _This_ is why we give things names.
